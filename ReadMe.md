This is my submission for the password generator homework. I am not sure if I did things the most efficient way, but it does work.
I am looking forward to hear about how I can streamline the functions and all 'moving parts' in general. Please note that I ommitted
a bit of the starter code (js:44-46) to make the method I found on w3collective work. Also interested in how to get this working while utilizing that piece of code.
